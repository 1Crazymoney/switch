# Are my funds secure?
Yes. The architecture of Switch means that you never need to trust a third party to hold you money. Before during and after a trade your money only ever belongs to you.

By comparison centralized cryptocurrency exchanges hold your money on your behalf and are regularly hacked, loosing users's funds.

# How is it so fast?
Switch achieves it's combination of speed and security by using "payment channels" - a futuristic blockchain feature often theorized about but only now achieving real implementation.

# What is Interledger?
Interledger is an open protocol suite for sending payments across different ledgers. Like routers on the Internet, connectors route packets of money across independent payment networks. The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system. Interledger is not tied to any one company, blockchain, or currency. 

# What is "layer 2" and "payment channels"?
Payment channels are a technology to speed up payments on blockchains while retaining strong security guarantees.

Money is transferred on the blockchain to a secure holding place. Then special messages can be sent between the sender and receiver that enable each to withdraw money from the holding place. Depending on the messages sent, the sender and receiver can withdraw varying amounts from the holding place; hence the messages act as real payments. These channels can then be linked together to send payments to anyone, rather than just the original two parties.

The longer money is held in channels the cheaper and faster payments can be overall. This idea of holding money in these channels is known as being "on layer 2" (as they form a layer above the underlying blockchain, which itself is known as layer 1).

# Why can't I trade sometimes, even though I have a balance?
Your money in the balance securely held in a payment channel. Normally this can be traded freely. However after a few trades the money enters a state where it cannot be sent. You "outgoing capacity" has reduced to too low a level. To fix this, deposit additional funds, or withdraw and deposit again.

# Why can't I see all my money on a card?
The card balance shows how much is held in "layer 2", that is in a payment channel.  
The rest of your funds are safely stored in the underlying blockchain and are viewable in an external wallet app.
